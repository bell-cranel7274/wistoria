# NotebookLM-Style AI Assistant - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ What Is This?

An AI-powered research assistant that helps you analyze, understand, and extract insights from your research notes - inspired by Google's NotebookLM.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Research Notes
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:4300/research

Click: "+ New Research Entry"

Fill in:
- Title: "Machine Learning Study"
- Content: Your research content
- Methodology: How you conducted the research
- Key Findings: Main discoveries
- Sources: References and citations
```

### Step 2: Open AI Assistant
```
Click the purple/pink "AI Assistant" button
(Top right of the research page)
```

### Step 3: Ask Questions or Use Quick Actions
```
Quick Actions (Click any):
ðŸ“š Summarize all research
ðŸ’¡ Key insights  
ðŸ“Š Research gaps
ðŸ”— Find connections

OR

Type your own question:
"What are the common themes in my research?"
```

## ðŸ’¬ Example Conversations

### Example 1: Getting a Summary
```
You: Summarize all my research on AI

AI: Based on your research notes:

Research Note 1 (Machine Learning Basics) discusses fundamental concepts...
Research Note 3 (Neural Networks) explores deep learning architectures...

The common theme across these notes is...

Referenced notes:
â€¢ RSH-123456-789 - Machine Learning Basics
â€¢ RSH-789012-345 - Neural Networks
```

### Example 2: Finding Connections
```
You: What connections exist between my different projects?

AI: Analyzing your research notes, I found several connections:

1. Research Note 2 and Note 4 both use similar methodologies...
2. Your findings in Note 1 support the hypothesis in Note 5...
3. Consider exploring the gap between...
```

### Example 3: Research Gaps
```
You: What should I research next?

AI: Based on Research Note 1, 2, and 3, here are areas needing more investigation:

1. You've researched theory extensively but lack practical implementations
2. Most sources are from 2020-2021, recent developments are missing
3. The connection between X and Y is mentioned but not explored...
```
