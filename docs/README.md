## 🔧 Architecture Overview

```
Frontend Dashboard (React) ←→ API Server (Node.js/Python/Go) ←→ Homelab Services
     This Project              Separate Project                  Your Hardware
```

The API server acts as a secure bridge between your web dashboard and actual homelab hardware, handling authentication, data transformation, and service orchestration.
